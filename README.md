# Judge0 Setup and Installation

Judge0 is an open-source online compiler that supports a wide variety of programming languages. This repository provides instructions for setting up and using Judge0 on your local machine with Docker and Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Ubuntu OS (or any other Linux-based operating system)

## Repository Setup

Follow these steps to set up Judge0 locally using Docker Compose.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NagapavanTechWorm/judge0.git
cd judge0-v1.12.0
```

### 2. Set Up and Start Dependencies

Judge0 relies on two main services: `db` (database) and `redis`. To start these services, run the following command:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d db redis
```

This will start the database and Redis services in detached mode. Wait for the services to initialize:

```bash
sleep 10s
```

### 3. Start the Judge0 Service

Now, you can start the Judge0 service along with its dependencies. Run:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

This will launch the Judge0 service in detached mode.

### 4. Wait for Services to Fully Initialize

After starting the services, wait a few seconds to allow everything to fully initialize:

```bash
sleep 5s
```

### 5. Check the Status of the Services

To check the status of the services, run:

```bash
sudo docker-compose ps
```

This will show the current status of all containers running, including Judge0, Redis, and the database.

## Accessing Judge0

Once all services are up and running, you can access the Judge0 API by sending requests to `http://<Your IP Address>/dummy-client.html` (by default).

## Stopping the Services

To stop the services, run:

```bash
sudo docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes created by Docker Compose.

## Configuration

You can modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to adjust the configuration of the services, such as port mappings, environment variables, etc.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the setup, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

- **Docker Permissions**: Ensure Docker is installed and running with appropriate permissions.
- **Service Initialization**: If the services don't seem to be starting correctly, try restarting Docker or checking the logs with `docker-compose logs`.
